# Changelog

## Version 1.0-beta.1 (July 4, 2013)

This is the first major release since the rewrite of the API Client. Tons of things have changed so make sure to upgrade!

 * Better logging with configurable verbosity.
 * Built-in shell that does not rely on bash, but does have lots of bash features like autocomplete and history (even reverse history search).
 * Configuration files are now in YAML.
 * Configuration files can be modified by using the client directly with the `--save` option.
 * Super easy install, just download the binary and go.
 * Download UI is now nicer with progress bars.
 * No more deleting files randomly to get the client to behave.

Let us know what you think!
